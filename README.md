# R_Project
This repository contains a basic-level bioinformatics analysis project using R and RStudio. The project demonstrates practical knowledge of R by analyzing gene expression data from the "airway" dataset. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, visualization, differential expression analysis, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis.
